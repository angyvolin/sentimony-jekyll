Sentimony Records proudly presents our second release - compilation Emptinesses. Carefully selected tracks from masters of chill-out vibes.

The compilation describes a saturated voyage into the Emptinesses of ambient and downtempo escapes, atmospheric dreamy melodies with beautiful floating sounds.

Twelve chillout tracks of relaxed down beats and high spirit tunes. A perfect soundtrack to listen to at the crack of dawn, and during peaceful silent sunset.

Consider for a moment! Listen to the beauty of Emptinesses...
